# Data Analyst Projects 

## About 
Hi! Thanks for checking out my Github repository. 

My name is Fatma! I enjoy working on climate related projects with the use of big data. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Meteorological Engineering. I currently pursue a Master of Science degree in Environmental Engineering. 

My Github repository contains three main components. 
The first part includes my projects I have completed since the beginning of my graduate studies. The lecture on “Scientific Programming and Data Analysis” helped me learn to clean, organize, and visualize data. Thanks to the lecture, I have been able to improve my object-oriented programming and to develop various functions. These projects mostly include environmental, meteorological, and climatological analysis. 

The second part of this repository is about my self-learning. I provide codes written for assignments from online courses as well as for Kaggle Projects. It is fun to learn coding on my own, but feel free to point out any issues you come across. 

The final part contains certificates that I obtain throughout my career. 

My contact information and social media accounts are also attached. So feel free to be in touch!
