# Data Analyst / Scientist Projects 

## About 
Hello, my name is Fatma, I have technical bacground Bachelor of Science Engineering (BSc(Eng)) in Meteorological Engineering and continuing Master of Science (M.S.) in Environmental Engineering (MSc). 

First part of this reposity is mainly include my projects that I have done during my Master Program. The Scientific Programming and Data Analysis lecture helped me learn to clean, organise and visualize data. Thanks to the lecture I have been able to develop computer programs codes functional and object oriented. These projects are mainly include environmental and especially meteorological or climatological analysis. 

Second part of this reposity include my projects that I have done under many online courses and Kaggle Projects. I love to handle with data and enjoy with my learning process. 

The third part include my certificates which I gained during courses
